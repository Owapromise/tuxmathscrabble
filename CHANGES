CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.7.2
===========================================
January 12, 2010

1.	If installed (installation only applies to Linux now, Win/Mac run from within package directory),
	then .tms_config_master located at /var/games/TuxMathScrabble/.tms_config_master and copied -> $HOME/.tms_config
	at user's first run.  Previously ran into permission problems if users try to change settings via admin.
	Now every user takes their own copy of the config file and saves in their $HOME.

CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.6.4
===========================================
June 20, 2009

1.	In the course of implementing the wx functionality as being "optional", various unforseen problems arose.  After 
	several iterations things should now be working as originally advertised.  Let's hope! In other words, no new 
	functionality, just making it work as advertised about 2 releases ago.


===========================================

=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-FINAL
December 24, 2007
=================================

None from rc5.

=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-rc5
December 23, 2007
=================================

MAX_REPLACEMENTS_L1-4: This directly affects the
number of possibilities considered by the computer
player, and thus how long each computer player takes 
to move.  Physically, this parameter controls the 
number of "wildcards" to attempt to incorporate from 
the existing entries on the board. So, if the computer
player is taking too long, reduce this parameter by
one for the level on which you wish to play (L1-L4).

Changed the tile style from double line border to
single line.

Restored alpha-layer configurability for tiles.

Added call to set_colorkey of highscore surface during 
play.

Hiding some parameters (toggling showme=0) to
reduce clutter in the admin control panel.



=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-rc4
December 20, 2007
=================================

Migrated from deprecated wxPython.wx package to wx.*
packages. This eliminates old/harmless crash-on-exit 
under MS-Windows.


In method tmssolver.generate_expressions the variable
MAX_REPLACEMENTS is a list, but was being refered
to as an integer.  This was an unfinished modification,
apparantly, and although it did not cause a crash, the
effect was to make the computer player to be a more
difficult opponent than intended on lower skill levels.
The subsequent references have now been modified like
MAX_REPLACEMENTS[self.LEVEL-1], which was the original
intent. 

Added "(Linux only)" to F9-line in help overlay.

Increased default value of MAXNUM_LEVEL_4 variable to
include 20 (was previously 19).

Sound functionality restored.


=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-rc3
December 19, 2007
=================================
Removed rotozoom operation on animated tiles and replaced with 
fixed-size images, still rotozoomed, but with scale-factor=1, for
starters.

Restored recording of high scores to encourage competition.

Changed the way the admin controls get called; previously it was
called @tms.handle_events(). Now it's called in TuxMathScrabbleApp
loop (top of tms.py file). No change in functionality.

Changed call in CftCtrl.py so calls self.reload_configs() rather
than previous self.reload(cfgname), which was crashing under certain
circumstances. 

=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-rc2
December 15, 2007
=================================

Fixed transparency of score widget when background image 
is configured to be used.

Added who's turn indicators.

Added difficulty level indicator (1-4).

Restored all character animations.

"None" is now a character option.

Using tile-color-coded score strings instead of score-string
widget in rc1.  Also using some better font settings from 
current development version of TuxWordSmith. See the page:
http://www.asymptopia.org/staticpages/index.php?page=tws-greek-english

Added global_config variable PLAYER_WAIT_COUNTER, which is
checked during tms.update() to determine if should queue waiting
maneuver. (looks/gestures/antics)

Bad animated tile graphics replaced using images from preliminary
3D blender modeling experiments. 

Button surfaces created dynamically -- this was last type surf 
remaining to be dealt with on-the-fly.

TuxMathScrabble splash screen while loading global_config-dependent
variables. (initially and after admin control panel popdown)


=================================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.5.0-rc1
December 13, 2007
=================================


Self-contained, no longer built upon libasymptopia. 
Now only 571k!

Dynamic tile creation, dynamic tile placement of
submission for computer player; ie, computer player's
tiles no longer simply appear at final submission location,
but are now animated to travel along line between tray and
submission spot.

0,1 or 2 human players (0=screensaver mode). The 2 human
players mode is new.

Keyboard HotKeys:
F1  Key: Cycle through game levels  		   
F4  Key: Screensaver mode					   
F5  Key: Shuffle tiles in place 			   
F8  Key: Exchange all tiles and sacrifice turn 
F9  Key: Show help  						   
F10 Key: Show credits						   
F11 Key: Screenshot to HOME directory		   
F12 Key: Fullscreen 						   
ESC Key: Quit 

New hat for player[1] character.

No cpu overhead when idle.

No accounts/logins. Anyone can tweak the settings. Defaults
are easily recovered by clicking the 'Default' button for
each configurable parameter in the admin control panel.

Dynamic/realtime application of changes made through admin 
control panel.

Fixed bgImage loading function.

MacFix?: Interchanged lines 26/27 in environment.py 
so search for 'darwin', the OS-X machine name, first. 
(previous env search for 'win' was finding 'darwin' on 
macs, thereby precluding correct install on macs).
NEED: Feedback from a Mac user please.

And lots more.

Much more has been changed, but these are the most 
noticable to the user. 


===========================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.4.5
===========================
Fixing small mess I made by changing version of underlying lib for
0.5.1 TuxWordSmith and leaving numbering the same (0.1.3) for TWS
and TMS, both, which breaks the first app installed, if you have
both TWS and TMS installed, since the 2nd install overwrites with 
a lib that's numbered the same but different in content.  whoops.
So this TMS-0.4.5 uses the newly modified lib 0.1.3, and even 
though it's the same number as the lib in TMS-0.4.4, it's of 
different content.  It would be better to make lib 0.1.4, but too
lazy to go through all those files and change that import.  So,
just install new version of TMS. 

This does not affect the windows versions since they are self-
contained and refer only to their own local subdirectories.

===========================
CHANGES TuxMathScrabble-0.4.3
===========================

Multi-resolution simulation module to generate example assessment data
High Scores fixed up
Character browser
unfinished 3D character experiments
